### About Me

From the age of 5, I have had a passion for playing basketball. Playing on an outside team, my school's middle school team, and now my high school team. However, beyond playing, I have also wanted to foster new generations of ball players. As a result, I have volunteered every Sunday to coach rascals different fundementals all from the place I first learned to play.

I also really enjoy hanging out with friends and listening to music!

In 7th Grdae, in a 20Time project, I have also made an entire website dedicated to helping incoming students at Whitney High School feel welcomed and comforatble around the school. This was called Operation: Chaperone Whitney and the website I created is linked here: [Link](http://operationchaperonewhitney.weebly.com/)
